# Owner Restricted

This plugin allows the conference if there is a moderator (`owner`) in the room.

It doesn't prevent guests to join the room but ends the meeting if there is
still no moderator after `timeout`.

When the last moderator leaves the room, it waits `timeout` seconds and ends the
meeting if the moderator doesn't come back.

> **Warning**: This plugin doesn't work correctly with breakout rooms.
