# Security On-Demand

This plugin dynamically enables/disables lobby or set/unset password for the
meeting room. The participant can update these values if they have permission to
join the meeting room.

## Installation

- Prerequisites:

  - Enable the lobby feature and test that it works as expected when manually
    activated by a moderator.

  - Set up
    [JWT auth](https://github.com/jitsi/lib-jitsi-meet/blob/master/doc/tokens.md)
    and check that it works before proceeding.

  - Check that you have
    `/usr/share/jitsi-meet/prosody-plugins/mod_persistent_lobby.lua`. If it's
    not there, that means your version of Jitsi does not yet include
    [this PR](https://github.com/jitsi/jitsi-meet/pull/12215) which is required.

- Copy this script to the Prosody plugins folder. It's the following folder on
  Debian:

  ```bash
  cd /usr/share/jitsi-meet/prosody-plugins/
  wget -O mod_token_security_ondemand.lua https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jitsi-contrib/prosody-plugins/main/token_security_ondemand/mod_token_security_ondemand.lua
  ```

- Enable the module in your prosody config, as well as the 'persistent_lobby'
  module.

  _/etc/prosody/conf.d/meet.mydomain.com.cfg.lua_

  ```lua
  Virtualhost "meet.mydomain.com"
    modules_enabled = {
      -- ...
      "muc_lobby_rooms";
      "persistent_lobby";
    }

  Component "conference.meet.mydomain.com" "muc"
    modules_enabled = {
      -- ... existing modules
      "token_security_ondemand";
    }
  ```

- Restart the services

  ```bash
  systemctl restart prosody.service
  ```
